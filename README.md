# ZTM Academy Final Project: SmartBrain Front-End

This project is built with React and an Image Recognition API from Clarifai. The web app has a registration and login page. Once the user is logged in, the user can submit image URLs and the API determines a face in the photo. Each photo submission increases the count.
